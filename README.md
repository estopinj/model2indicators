# model2indicators

## This git repository gathers the code supporting a research article published in Ecological Informatics:
Estopinan J, Servajean M, Bonnet P, Joly A, Munoz F. Mapping global orchid assemblages with deep learning provides novel conservation insights. Ecological Informatics. 2024 May 10:102627.
[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102627 ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102627)


- The [website](https://mapviewer.plantnet.org/?config=apps/store/orchid-status.xml#) provides access to the produced indicators on species assemblages *[anonymized for double blind peer review].*

What is included here:
- The trained model exploited to predict worldwide orchid species assemblages
- The python scripts to go from a trained pytorch model to Cloud Optimized Geotiffs maps of the indicators
- The python scripts to reproduce article figures [on-going]
